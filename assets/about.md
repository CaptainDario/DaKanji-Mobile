DaKanji helps students of the Japanese language and people who use it.
Right now it can recognize handwritten characters:

- all 漢字 from 漢字検定
- ひらがな (also historical ones: ゑ, etc.)
- カタカナ (also historical ones: ヱ, etc.)
- arabic numbers
- romaji

But the feature set will be vastly improved in the coming releases.

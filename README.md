## What is this
This app tries to help students and people which use the Japanese language.
It can recognize Japanese 'kanji' characters which the user draws by hand.
Those predictions can than be automatically opened in dictionaries.
For more details about the features take a look at the [usage section](#usage).

</br>

## Getting started
**Currently only android is supported** </br>
The easiest way is to download the app for android from the PlayStore.
You can also download the latest release from the [releases page](https://github.com/CaptainDario/DaKanji-Mobile/releases) or [setup a development environment](#development) and build the app on your own.

## Usage
In this section the features of the app are explained in more detail.
### Handwritten kanji recognition
The user can draw a character in the UI and the app will predict which character was drawn. This prediction can than be opened in a dictionary of choice. A dictionary can be chosen in the settings.
It is also possible to use a translation app or custom URL can be defined in the settings menu.</br>
Currently around 3000 characters are supported. 
All supported characters can be found [here](https://github.com/CaptainDario/DaKanji-Mobile/blob/main/assets/labels_CNN_kanji_only.txt).</br>
